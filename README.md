# Auto-MPG
Auto-mpg  Mileage per gallon performances of various cars
## About data
- This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".
## Attribute Information
- 1. mpg: continuous
- 2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
- 3. displacement: continuous
- 4. horsepower: continuous
- 5. weight: continuous
- 6. acceleration: continuous
- 7. model year: multi-valued discrete
